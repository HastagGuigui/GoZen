# GoZen - Github Pages site

This is the branch for the GoZen website, this website is very much a wip and won't receive much attention until the editor itself, GoZen, gets into a stability testing phase before release.

If you want to improve upon this site, feel free to. We use the same color codes as the editor (except for the purple urls which is a bit lighter), and we try to maintain the same style as how the editor looks and feels.
